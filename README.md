# Economic-Data-Analysis
This projects aims to analyse the economic data of the United States , mainly analysing unemployment data and drawing conclusions & correlations.

I am an economics enthusiast and I keep myself updated with latest economic trends. Coming from a computer science background, I always wondered if there is a way through which we can leverage programming knowledge in the field of economics. 
Traditional economic analysis is done using R and Stata but I wanted to use my tech stack knowledge of python to make analysis. In this project I do a micro analytical exercise where I analyse economic data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data repository. The reason I chose US was because the American market tends to trickle down on global economics in general. Also, the US markets have a well maintained data repo which is easy to access and work with. 

In this project we will do the following:
1. Scrape economic data from Federal Reserve using FRED API
2. Analyse the S&P 500 index in context of all US states
3. Join two datasets: Unemployement & Labour Participations in order to draw correlations.
4. Analyse common trend amongst all states.
5. Look for outliers (Like California in our case) and infer economic factors leading to the anomaly.
6. Write final remarks for the analysis.
